It may yet contain egregious bugs, even data loss bugs. Use at your own risk.==================================================Installation==================================================To install Loki, place this entire directory at some location that is accessible via your web server. Loki's JavaScript currently resides in many different files (it will be available as one large script file when officially released). Currently, the easiest way to include them all on a page and to integrate it with an existing server-side system is to use a helper script. One such script for PHP is available in the helpers directory. It can be used as a model for writing other scripts in different languages.==================================================License==================================================See license.txt for the full text of the license under which Loki is distributed.
