Place this entire directory at some location that is accessible via your web server.2. Include the loki.js file in a <script> tag in the <head> on the page(s) where you wish to use Loki.3. Instantiate Loki, using code such as the sample below. The possible settings and options for Loki are still being documented; for now, please consult the source code of the PHP helper (specifically Loki2::print_form_children()) for information on the settings and options.Example code:<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">	/**	 * Convert a textarea to use Loki. Provide either a textarea object,	 * the ID of a textarea or a function to return either as the "textarea"	 * parameter.	 */	function convert_textarea(textarea)	{		function do_conversion()		{			if (!UI || !Util) {				throw new Error('Loki does not appear to be loaded!');			}						if (typeof(textarea) == 'function')				textarea = textarea()						if (typeof(textarea) == 'string') // ID given				textarea = document.getElementById(textarea)						if (!textarea) {				throw new Error("Please provide a valid textarea.");			}						var loki = new UI.Loki;			var options = (new UI.Loki_Options).init(['default']); // or 'all'						var https = (Util.URI.parse(window.location).scheme == 'https');						var settings = {				base_uri: 'URL to Loki folder',				use_https: https,				use_xhtml: true,				options: options			};						loki.init(textarea, settings);		}				// Use the Loki utility code to listen for the window's load event.		Util.Event.observe(window, 'load', do_conversion);	}</script>==================================================Building==================================================While Loki is distributed and used on web pages as one (large) JavaScript file, development occurs across many smaller files. Source tarballs of Loki include these individual files instead of the large single file for people who want to inspect or work on Loki's code.The source distribution also includes a build script at tools/build. By default, it builds a distribution tarball of Loki that can be extracted an installed as described in the "Installation" section above. For frequent work on Loki, however, it also supports a --js-only option that will compile and output the main loki.js file to standard output. Run the build script with the --help option for more information.==================================================License==================================================Loki is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU LGPL) version 2.1. See license.txt for the full text of the license under which Loki is distributed.
