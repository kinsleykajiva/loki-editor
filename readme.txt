Release announcements are also posted to this list.<http://groups.google.com/group/loki-installers>==================================================Installation==================================================(If you downloaded a source tarball of Loki, please read the "Building" section below first.)Loki's installation documentation is available online at its project page.<http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/wiki/Installation>==================================================Building==================================================While Loki is distributed and used on web pages as one (large) JavaScript file, development occurs across many smaller files. Source tarballs of Loki include these individual files instead of the large single file for people who want to inspect or work on Loki's code.The source distribution also includes a build script at tools/build. By default, it builds a distribution tarball of Loki that can be extracted an installed as described in the "Installation" section above. For frequent work on Loki, however, it also supports a --js-only option that will compile and output the main loki.js file to standard output. Run the build script with the --help option for more information.==================================================License==================================================Loki is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU LGPL) version 2.1. See license.txt for the full text of the license under which Loki is distributed.
