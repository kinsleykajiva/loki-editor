Loki will transform any `textarea` entry field into a "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) editor.

Loki is different from other open source browser-based WYSIWYG editors in its focus on web standards compliance and in its encouragement of semantic markup.

It is currently compatible with Internet Explorer and Gecko-based browsers (e.g. [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/)).

## Interested in using Loki? ##
Loki has reached a stable release and is suitable for general use.

After downloading Loki from the green box at the right, you can get started with Loki by reading the [installation documents](Installation.md).

The best place to go with any questions is [the Loki installers discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/loki-installers). (_Installers_ is our term for people who wish to use Loki in an application to distinguish them from _users_, the people who simply use Loki to create and edit documents.)

_Please note that this project is **not a character editor** for [Loki, the game](http://www.loki-game.com/)._
