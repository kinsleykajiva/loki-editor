==Loki 2.0 Release Candidate 1 _(January 29, 2008)_==
  * When linking to an existing item, anchors now appear in the order in which they appear in the item, not in alphabetical order. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=50 #50])
  * Fixed a bug where the link dialog would sometimes not load the list of existing items. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=52 #52])
  * Fixed a bug where containers that should only contain either zero or two or more paragraphs were not cleaned up if they only contained a single paragraph. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=48 #48])
  * The PHP helper no longer relies on the SCRIPT_URI server variable, which is not always available. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=53 #53])
  * Fixed a bug where the Loki HTML parser sometimes overran the ends of tags.  ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=57 #57])
  * The !JavaScript generated by the PHP helper is now more error-aware and more robust in cases where multiple instances of Loki are being generated on one page.
  * The readme file is now more informative (but still not informative enough).
  * Internals:
    * Better support for operations on ranges in Internet Explorer: better node insertion and range positioning implementations, implementations for cloning and deleting the contents of the range, and the ability to create new ranges on documents.
    * New utility functions for traversing a DOM node's ancestry and finding its offset within its parent.
    * The Python helper (and thus the build script) now ignores !JavaScript files that begin with ".". Certain editors can leave these files lying around, and they were being erroneously included in builds.


==Loki 2.0 Beta 4 _(January 19, 2008)_==
  * The new link dialog will now default to displaying the tab that was last used to create a link. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=37 #37])
  * Pressing Enter/Return within a dialog now submits it (unless the cursor is in a position where Enter does something special, like selecting a dropdown item). ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=38 #38])
  * The link dialog now allows the user to manually enter in an anchor name when the list of anchors can not be determined. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=19 #19])
  * A button was added to the toolbar that forces Loki to clean up the editing document when it is pressed. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=56 #56])
  * Loki can now always cleanup pasted content, even if the user uses the browser's menu to do so or otherwise bypasses Loki's clipboard capabilities. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=54 #54])
  * Loki now better enforces proper HTML document structure. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=55 #55])
  * The above cleanup changes fix some bizarre Mozilla behavior that occurs when plain text with line breaks is pasted in. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=8 #8])
  * Error messages are now cleared when the retry link is clicked. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=25 #25])
  * Loki can now be configured to allow changes to the size of an image made using the browser's controls to be preserved when the document is saved. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=27 #27])
  * Illegally self-nested HTML elements (e.g. a `B` tag within another `B` tag) are now cleaned up. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=29 #29])
  * Loki now cleans up unnecessary `BR` tags that are the last children of their parents. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=39 #39])
  * The labels on the indent and outdent buttons were changed to be more friendly and informative. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=43 #43])


==Loki 2.0 Beta 3 _(December 19, 2007)_==
  * Fixed a bug that made it impossible to link to an anchor on the item being edited. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=4 #4])
  * The link dialog no longer displays the last existing item you linked to as the default when the user goes to create a new link to an existing item. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=5 #5])
  * Directly editing anchors is now possible. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=13 #13])
  * Loki no longer replaces special punctuation characters with ASCII equivalents. ([http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=14 #14])
