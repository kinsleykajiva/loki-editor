Do not use it for anything real. It may break and lose your data, so usage for any live service is seriously discouraged.==================================================Installation==================================================To install Loki, put this entire directory on your webserver, and update the information in paths.php to be appropriate. There's a lot of non-loki related junk in there right now (Loki will also be distributed as part of a content management suite called Reason) but you can ignore everything there. Put the paths.php file in a directory in the php include path, or alternately you can add the loki directory to the php include path.Sample code for integrating Loki into a PHP script is included in the file Loki.php.==================================================License==================================================See licence.txt for the full LGPL license.
