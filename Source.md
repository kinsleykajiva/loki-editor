Loki's source code is not managed through Google Code, but instead hosted at [GitHub](http://github.com/carleton/loki/) and uses [Git](http://git-scm.com/) as its source control system.

Anyone can clone the Loki Git repository locally by running `git clone git://github.com/carleton/loki.git`, but if you would possibly like to contribute your changes back to the official Loki distribution, it's easiest to make a fork on GitHub. Just visit [Loki's GitHub project page](http://github.com/carleton/loki/) and hit "fork"!
