#summary A summary of the our ability to create keyboard shortcuts by browser and OS
#labels Audience-Developers

As described in [http://code.google.com/p/loki-editor/issues/detail?id=28 issue 28], using our current (2.1) implementation, we are not able to trap the accelerator key combinations to trigger our editing functions under all browsers. This document details the support.

==Legend==
  * *Working* – The implementation that we have currently works just fine.
  * *Non-working* – The implementation doesn't work, but it is unknown whether or not it can be made to work.
  * *Impossible* – Research has been done, but it appears that this is an impossible task on the platform.
  * *Unknown* – It is not known whether or not this works yet.
  * *_N/A_* – The browser/OS combination does not actually exist.

==Status==

|| || *Internet Explorer 7* || *Firefox 2* || *Camino 1.5* || *Safari 3.0.4* || *!WebKit 525*^1^ || *Opera 9.5* ||
|| *Windows* || Working || Working || _N/A_ || Non-working || Unknown || Working  ||
|| *Mac OS X* || _N/A_ || Impossible || Impossible || Working || Working || Non-working ||

==Notes==
  # !WebKit 525 refers to the [http://nightly.webkit.org latest nightly builds of Safari 2] at the time of this writing (2007-12-23). It includes some changes to keyboard event behavior over !WebKit 523.x (Safari 3), and thus is worth listing separately.
