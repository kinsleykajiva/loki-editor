#summary Describes the available editing options
#labels Audience-Installers

Loki includes many different editing options that can be enabled or disabled at will. The desired options are given as the `options` [Settings setting].

Two default sets of options are included in Loki: `default`, a slightly-limited set of features that are suitable for most users; and `power`, a larger set of features suitable for power users. Individual options can be added and subtracted from these sets by appending their identifiers to the end, prefixed with a `+` or a `-` as desired.

For instructions on how to give this option string to Loki, see [Initialization the initialization article].

===Examples===
|| *Selector* || *Description* ||
|| `"default"` || Includes all the items in the default set. ||
|| `"default + underline"` || Includes all the items in the default set, plus underlining. ||
|| `"power - anchors - tables"` || Includes all the items in the power user set except for anchors and tables. ||
|| `"power - blockquotes + underline - source"` || Includes all the items in the power user set except for blockquotes and source code editing, and adds in underlining. ||
