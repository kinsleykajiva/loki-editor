#summary A reference of Loki settings
#labels Audience-Installers

Loki has many settings to customize its behavior that can be passed to `UI.Loki.init()`. A reference table is given below; for information how to pass these settings in or set up Loki in general, see [Installation the article on installing Loki].

Some settings are actually required (currently only *base_uri*); the names of these settings are printed in *bold*.

|| *Name* || *Type* || *Description * ||
|| allowable_tags || array || An array of allowed HTML tags, given in upper case. Loki will remove any tags from the document that do not appear in this list. If this is not specified, a fairly permissive default list that is built-in to Loki will be used. ||
|| *base_uri* || string || The URL of the Loki folder. Loki uses this to pull in icons, CSS files, etc. ||
|| default_site_regexp || regexp || A regular expression that matches the default site to link to. For more information, see [CMSIntegration the article on CMS integration]. ||
|| default_type_regexp || regexp || A regular expression that matches the default type that can be linked to. For more information, see [CMSIntegration the article on CMS integration]. ||
|| disallow_image_sizes || boolean || Most browsers allow images in the document to be resized, but if `disallow_image_sizes` is set to true, the edited sizes will be stripped out when the document is saved. Defaults to false. ||
|| finder_feed || string || The URL to be pulled up to determine the site and type of a link. For more information, see [CMSIntegration the article on CMS integration]. ||
|| images_feed || string || The RSS feed of available images. For more information, see [CMSIntegration the article on CMS integration]. ||
|| sanitize_unsecured || boolean || When Loki is loaded over `https` and the document it is editing contains images loaded over unencrypted `http`, most browsers will complain of a security threat. If `sanitize_unsecured` is set to true, these images will be replaced with placeholders that will not trigger the security warning. Defaults to false. (Note that if the image is on the same host as Loki, Loki will simply try to load the images over `https`, regardless of the state of this setting.) ||
|| sites_feed || string || The RSS feed of available sites. For more information, see [CMSIntegration the article on CMS integration]. ||
|| use_xhtml || boolean || Cleans up the browser-generated HTML to always be in XHTML format. Note that this doesn't do rigorous validation, but merely does simple corrections like ensuring that tags are in lower case and self-closing tags get a closing slash (/). Defaults to false. ||
